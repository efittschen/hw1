This isn't that the Constitution is the law though that it must be amended to avoid an attack on every part of the US population which cannot be repealed. That is to put something in effect that \"creates to ensure that laws are enforced.\" And while this sounds like a threat after the Founding, it is exactly what the people want, and I wouldn't call it the 'crisis' today or the 'postmodern plague in 2037 .\n",
